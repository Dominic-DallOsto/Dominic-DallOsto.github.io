  abstract = {To navigate their environment, insects need to keep track of their orientation. Previous work has shown that insects encode their head direction as a sinusoidal activity pattern around a ring of neurons arranged in an eight-column structure. However, it is unclear whether this sinusoidal encoding of head direction is just an evolutionary coincidence or if it offers a particular functional advantage. To address this question, we establish the basic mathematical requirements for direction encoding and show that it can be performed by many circuits, all with different activity patterns. Among these activity patterns, we prove that the sinusoidal one is the most noise-resilient, but only when coupled with a sinusoidal connectivity pattern between the encoding neurons. We compare this predicted optimal connectivity pattern with anatomical data from the head direction circuits of the locust and the fruit fly, finding that our theory agrees with experimental evidence. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our predicted circuit can emerge using Hebbian plasticity, implying that the neural connectivity does not need to be explicitly encoded in the genetic program of the insect but rather can emerge during development. Finally, we illustrate that in our theory, the consistent presence of the eight-column organisation of head direction circuits across multiple insect species is not a chance artefact but instead can be explained by basic evolutionary principles.},

  abstract = {Neural networks have long been a promising model for creating high performance robotic systems, from robot navigation and SLAM to modern deep learning techniques for tasks like manipulation. Traditional neural network systems typically relied heavily on a large number of hand-tuned parameters, while many modern implementations perform end-to-end learning, often with extreme data and computational requirements. Past work has focused on achieving high performance in real world environments, but with extensive hand tuning. In this paper, we instead present a new framework for automatically calibrating and optimising the performance of a biologically inspired neural network SLAM system. This framework combines a preset network structure with learning procedures. We use simulations with realistic noise to demonstrate the system's ability to learn the basic components of SLAM: odometry integration, landmark learning and landmarkdriven relocalisation. We also show the framework is able to calibrate a large range of network sizes, allowing rapid development and deployment of a bio-inspired SLAM system. Our work serves as a bridging contribution between traditional hand-crafted neural networks and modern end-to-end learning approaches.},
