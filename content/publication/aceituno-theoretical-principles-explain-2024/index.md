abstract: To navigate their environment, insects need to keep track of their orientation.
  Previous work has shown that insects encode their head direction as a sinusoidal
  activity pattern around a ring of neurons arranged in an eight-column structure.
  However, it is unclear whether this sinusoidal encoding of head direction is just
  an evolutionary coincidence or if it offers a particular functional advantage. To
  address this question, we establish the basic mathematical requirements for direction
  encoding and show that it can be performed by many circuits, all with different
  activity patterns. Among these activity patterns, we prove that the sinusoidal one
  is the most noise-resilient, but only when coupled with a sinusoidal connectivity
  pattern between the encoding neurons. We compare this predicted optimal connectivity
  pattern with anatomical data from the head direction circuits of the locust and
  the fruit fly, finding that our theory agrees with experimental evidence. Furthermore,
  we demonstrate that our predicted circuit can emerge using Hebbian plasticity, implying
  that the neural connectivity does not need to be explicitly encoded in the genetic
  program of the insect but rather can emerge during development. Finally, we illustrate
  that in our theory, the consistent presence of the eight-column organisation of
  head direction circuits across multiple insect species is not a chance artefact
  but instead can be explained by basic evolutionary principles.
