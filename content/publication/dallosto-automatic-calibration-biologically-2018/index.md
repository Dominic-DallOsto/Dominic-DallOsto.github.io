abstract: "Neural networks have long been a promising model for creating high performance
  robotic systems, from robot navigation and SLAM to modern deep learning techniques
  for tasks like manipulation. Traditional neural network systems typically relied
  heavily on a large number of hand-tuned parameters, while many modern implementations
  perform end-to-end learning, often with extreme data and computational requirements.
  Past work has focused on achieving high performance in real world environments,
  but with extensive hand tuning. In this paper, we instead present a new framework
  for automatically calibrating and optimising the performance of a biologically inspired
  neural network SLAM system. This framework combines a preset network structure with
  learning procedures. We use simulations with realistic noise to demonstrate the
  system's ability to learn the basic components of SLAM: odometry integration, landmark
  learning and landmarkdriven relocalisation. We also show the framework is able to
  calibrate a large range of network sizes, allowing rapid development and deployment
  of a bio-inspired SLAM system. Our work serves as a bridging contribution between
  traditional hand-crafted neural networks and modern end-to-end learning approaches."
